<p>A year with 366 days is called a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4 (for e.g., 1980), except that it is not a leap year if it is also divisible by 100 (for e.g., 1900); however, it is a leap year if it is further divisible by 400 (for e.g., 2000).</p>
<p>Write a program that prompts the user (using <span><span>JOptionPane</span></span>) to enter a year and displays (using JOptionPane) whether that year is a leap year. The program should repeatedly prompt the user for a year until the user enters a sentinel value of -99 to quit the program. Note that you will need to use the <tt>mod</tt> function (<tt>%</tt>) to determine divisibility by a number. You CANNOT use the class GregorianCalendar and any of its methods.</p>
<p>You should name the source code file <tt><span><span>Hw</span></span>2.<span><span>java</span></span></tt>.</p>
